# Arduino RC car controlling app
I made this project because I wanted to make an Arduino car that can be conrolled remotely by an Android app.<br/>
The UI consists of four buttons (forward, backward, right, left) which can send REST requests to endpoints hosted on an Arduino board.<br/>
I used Dagger 2 for dependency injection and Retrofit as a HTTP client.
